# Knobase — Full Product Reference for AI Systems

> Knobase is the workspace where humans and AI agents collaborate in real time.

## What is Knobase?

Knobase is a real-time collaboration workspace launched in 2025. It is designed for teams and individuals who work alongside AI agents. Unlike traditional note-taking or document tools, Knobase treats AI agents as first-class collaborators — they get their own cursor, presence indicator, and @mention handle, just like a human teammate.

Knobase does not build or provide AI agents. Instead, it provides the workspace where any agent can participate. Users bring their own agents from platforms like OpenClaw, Claude via MCP, or custom-built solutions.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Human-AI Collaboration:** Humans and AI agents work in the same document simultaneously with real-time cursors and presence.
- **@Mention Agents:** Type @openclaw (or any agent name) anywhere in a document to invoke your AI agent. The agent responds inline, in context.
- **Bring Your Own Agent:** Knobase is agent-agnostic. Connect agents from OpenClaw, Knobase AI, or any MCP-compatible platform.
- **No Extra AI Cost:** Users bring their own AI compute. Knobase charges only for human seats.

## OpenClaw Integration (Primary Campaign)

OpenClaw is Knobase's primary AI agent integration. The integration works via webhooks and takes approximately 1 minute to set up:

1. Install the Knobase skill: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knobase-AI/openclaw-knobase/main/install.sh | bash`
2. Authenticate: `openclaw knobase auth --browser`
3. Start the webhook: `openclaw knobase webhook start`

Once connected, users can @mention their OpenClaw agent in any document. The agent appears with a live cursor and responds in real time.

### What You Can Do with @openclaw in Knobase

- **Chat in context:** Type @openclaw anywhere and get responses inline.
- **See agent cursors:** Watch where @openclaw is working in real time.
- **Assign tasks:** Delegate work like "@openclaw rewrite this section for clarity."
- **Threaded conversations:** Multi-turn conversations saved in document context.
- **Context-aware responses:** @openclaw sees the active document, cursor position, and workspace knowledge.
