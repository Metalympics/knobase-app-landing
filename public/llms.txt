# Knobase

> The workspace where humans and AI agents collaborate in real time.

Knobase is a real-time collaboration workspace designed for teams that work with AI agents. Invite your AI agent — from OpenClaw, Claude via MCP, or any custom build — and work side by side in the same document, with live cursors, @mentions, and full workspace context.
